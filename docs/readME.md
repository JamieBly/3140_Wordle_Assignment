Wordle Game.

The game will start on a Home Screen. The home screen will contain a 'Play' Button to proceed to the actual game.
Once user selects 'Play' button, a word will be selected, and they will be prompted to guess the word. The user will have 6 guesses, and after each guess they will be be shown whether the letters in the word they guessed are present in the actual word. Green for in correct position, Yellow for in word but not the correct position, and red for not in the word.

There will be a bank for words in an external file that will be randomly selected upon the player clicking the "play Game" button and moving to the game page. My intent was to track how many total guesses, games played and games won each player had, but I was unable to successfully complete that part of the project.

I had difficulties with PHP/AJAX, and am handing what I have, which is essentially everything but the PHP sessions variables not tracking the number of guess and wins correctly.
