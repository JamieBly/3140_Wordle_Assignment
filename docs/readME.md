Wordle Game.

The game will start on a Home Screen. The home screen will contain a 'Play' Button to proceed to the actual game.
Once user selects 'Play' button, a word will be selected, and they will be prompted to guess the word. The user will have 6 guesses, and after each guess they will be be shown whether the letters in the word they guessed are present in the actual word. Green for in correct position, Yellow for in word but not the correct position, and red for not in the word.

I originally wanted to have a "bank" of words in an external document that I would read into the game each time, that would have 5000+ words to randomly choose from. I couldn't get it to work properly, and decided to hardcode on words for the time being, as I am quite busy, and need to work on other things. I also wanted to implement a system where players could "Play Again" and keep track of percentages, but ran into similar issues.
