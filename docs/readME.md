CSI3140 - Assignment 2

Wordle Game.

The game will start on a Home Screen. The home screen will contain a 'Play' Button, and statistics from current session, including games played, percentage won, and average guesses.
Once user selects 'Play' button, a word will be selected, and they will be prompted to guess the word. The user will have 6 guesses, and after each guess they will be be shown whether the letters in the word they guessed are present in the actual word. Green for in correct position, Yellow for in word but not the correct position, and red for not in the word.
At the end of the guessing, user will be prompted to return to the home screen or play again.

Borrowed the list of 5 Letters Words from https://github.com/charlesreid1. Appreciate them putting it out there, and saving me some time!
